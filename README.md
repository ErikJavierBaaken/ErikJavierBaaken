- 👋 Hi, I’m @ErikJavierBaaken
- 👀 I’m interested in this new world called programming. There's a lot out there and much to grasp. I feel like a noob and can call myself this for now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a novice level. For now. 
- 📫 How to reach me for starters will be here on GitHub.
